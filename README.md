OWASP Juice Shop is probably the most modern and sophisticated insecure
web application! It can be used in security trainings, awareness demos,
CTFs and as a guinea pig for security tools! Juice Shop encompasses
vulnerabilities from the entire
[OWASP Top Ten](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Top_Ten) along
with many other security flaws found in real-world applications!

   of the repository)
3. Go into the cloned folder with `cd ctf`
4. Run `npm install` (only has to be done before first start or when you
   change the source code)
5. Run `npm start`
6. Browse to <http://localhost:3000>

### Docker Container [![Docker Automated build](https://img.shields.io/docker/automated/bkimminich/juice-shop.svg)](https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/kimdane/ctf/) [![Docker Pulls](https://img.shields.io/docker/pulls/bkimminich/juice-shop.svg)](https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/kimdane/ctf/) ![Docker Stars](https://img.shields.io/docker/stars/bkimminich/juice-shop.svg) [![](https://images.microbadger.com/badges/image/bkimminich/juice-shop.svg)](https://microbadger.com/images/bkimminich/juice-shop "Get your own image badge on microbadger.com") [![](https://images.microbadger.com/badges/version/bkimminich/juice-shop.svg)](https://microbadger.com/images/bkimminich/juice-shop "Get your own version badge on microbadger.com")

1. Install [Docker](https://www.docker.com)
2. Run `docker pull kimdane/ctf`
3. Run `docker run --rm -p 3000:3000 kimdane/ctf`
4. Browse to <http://localhost:3000> (on macOS and Windows browse to
   <http://192.168.99.100:3000> if you are using docker-machine instead
   of the native docker installation)

> If you want to run Juice Shop on a Raspberry Pi 3, there is an
> unofficial Docker image available at
> <https://hub.docker.com/r/arclight/juice-shop_arm> which is based on
> `resin/rpi-raspbian` and maintained by
> [@battletux](https://github.com/battletux).

   [Virtualbox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)

   clone [your own fork](https://github.com/kimdane/ctf/fork)
   of the repository)
3. Run `cd vagrant && vagrant up`
4. Browse to [192.168.33.10:3000](http://192.168.33.10:3000)

> There is a very convenient Vagrant box available at
> <https://app.vagrantup.com/commjoen/boxes/trainingbox> (:microscope:)
> from [@commjoen](https://github.com/commjoen) which comes with latest
> Docker containers of the OWASP Juice Shop,
> [OWASP WebGoat](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_WebGoat_Project)
> and other vulnerable web applications as well as pentesting tools like
> [OWASP ZAP](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Zed_Attack_Proxy_Project).


## Customization

Via a YAML configuration file in `/config`, the OWASP Juice Shop can be
customized in its content and look & feel.

For detailed instructions and examples please refer to
[our _Customization_ documentation](https://bkimminich.gitbooks.io/pwning-owasp-juice-shop/content/part1/customization.html).

## CTF-Extension

If you want to run OWASP Juice Shop as a Capture-The-Flag event, we
recommend you set it up along with a [CTFd](https://ctfd.io) server
conveniently using the official
[`juice-shop-ctf-cli`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/juice-shop-ctf-cli)
tool.

For step-by-step instructions and examples please refer to
[the _Hosting a CTF event_ chapter](https://bkimminich.gitbooks.io/pwning-owasp-juice-shop/content/part1/ctf.html)
of our companion guide ebook.
